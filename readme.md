This is another OOP project that I am doing that involves the following classes: Car, Human and Gas Station. I am finding that I like making these simple OOP projects. However, when they get so large they get harder and harder to work with. I think that I will stick with the smaller projects for now. Meaning, having just a few classes and the objects that will be interacting.
